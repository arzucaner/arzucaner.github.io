#Exploring the Codewars Universe: A Developer’s Journey

##“To solve a problem, madness is required; to investigate, a genius is necessary.” — Sherlock Holmes
Since my childhood, I have enjoyed solving mysteries. I’ve always read books and watched films in this direction. In fact, I’m a fan of Sherlock Holmes. When curiosity is added to the mystery in my life, solving problems becomes very enjoyable for me.

###When I started as an apprentice at Lonca (Lonca (Guild) is a school of software engineering that follows the software craftsmanship movement, emphasizing an approach to equip students with industry-quality software development skills), I got introduced to Codewars. Because in Lonca’s educational system, you are encouraged and motivated to improve yourself by solving katas on Codewars.

##What is Codewars, and Why Is Solving Problems There Important?

Codewars is a platform for software developers to enhance their coding skills and practice in commonly used programming languages. This platform includes thousands of programming and algorithm questions categorized by various difficulty levels and topics.
The questions on Codewars simulate programming challenges that you might encounter in real-world applications. This enables developers to practice and improve their skills while learning new concepts.

Additionally, Codewars helps you enhance your algorithm skills. Initially, solving problems and grasping the logic behind them may seem challenging and time-consuming. I remember spending hours on a single problem, sometimes unable to solve it.
However, if you have curiosity and determination, you won’t give up on solving that problem. In fact, the time spent on solving a problem becomes the foundation for lasting learning.

##What things did I pay attention to while solving questions?

###First, I choose the programming language I want to solve from the “Practice” section. I determine the difficulty of the problem from the “Difficulty” section. I started with 8 kyu and sometimes looked at 7 kyu, but my goal is to complete all 8 kyu challenges.
Then, I specify the topic from the “Tags” section. Because I’ve been curious about many topics so far, I’ve tried most of them, but since I usually select JavaScript in the “Language” section, the areas I mostly choose are Arrays, String, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and Lists.

When solving a problem, Codewars provides excellent resources. When you can’t pass the test, it gives you clues about where the error originates. Just by following these hints, you can easily solve it.
After solving the problem and passing the test, it also provides other solved examples related to that question. You can compare your solution with best practices and get inspiration from other examples. 

##What resources did I use while solving questions?

###For question solutions, I primarily use https://developer.mozilla.org/. If I need another source, I refer to https://stackoverflow.com/.
If I ever can’t solve a question, I used to take a break for a couple of days and then revisit it. But now, at Lonca, I have my dear friend Taiga. After solving the question, I asked Taiga to show me the options related to that question.
Taiga generously shares all the information. If I can’t solve a question, I no longer wait. Instead, I immediately asked, “Could you help me with this question that I couldn’t solve?” Taiga provides excellent hints, and if I request, explains the solution methods in detail. It helps me use my time more efficiently and contributes significantly to my improvement. Thanks again, dear friend Taiga! You are a mysterious hero.

##Additional Resources for Problem Solving

###LeetCode is a popular platform that offers algorithm and data structure questions in various programming languages. It is also used for interview preparation. HackerRank is a platform that provides questions on different topics (algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, databases, security, etc.). It also offers questions tailored to interview types for interview preparation.
How I Developed the Discipline of Problem Solving?
Since adding it to my daily to-do list, I’ve been trying to solve a question every day. I’ve accumulated a decent number of points. In fact, the point system is somewhat like a reward, and occasionally checking your points can be quite satisfying.
As a result, I understand how much problem-solving has improved me when I’m coding. Additionally, you get to refresh your knowledge. It makes it easier to tackle live coding excitement during interview processes.

###Let’s see where our hero’s journey will intersect with other paths.
###Stay tuned!
###Enjoy problem-solving!
