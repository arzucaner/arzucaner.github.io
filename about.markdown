# Hi! I'm Arzu Caner
I began my professional journey in the telecommunications industry within the field of marketing. Over time, I specialized in digital projects and SEO, acquiring valuable skills. Now, I am forging my career path as a Frontend Developer, leveraging my expertise to create exceptional web experiences.

I take immense pleasure in crafting user-friendly web applications using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and Vue.js.In addition to my front-end skills, I am proficient in web technologies like Bootstrap, Bulma, and Figma. I have experience in using Docker for cloud deployment, and my expertise in Agile and Scrum methodologies enables me to work effectively in cross-functional teams. I have hands-on experience with technologies like Node.js and utilize Jest for testing and MongoDB for database management. I continually expand my knowledge and skills in both front-end and back-end development to create high-quality web applications that deliver value to users.

I have a deep passion for sharing and teaching what I've learned. With this passion, I serve as a volunteer evangelist at Women Who Code, dedicated to the advancement of women in the tech industry.

If you are considering involving me in a project or collaboration, please do not forget to take a look at my portfolio. I eagerly await the opportunity to work with companies that value creativity, collaboration, and innovation.
